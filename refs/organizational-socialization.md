# Organizational Socialization

Organization socialization is a "process by which an individual comes to appreciate the values, abilities, expected behaviors, and social knowledge essetial for assuming an organizational role and for participating as an organizational member." -- Meryl Reis Louis, 1980

Research from Georgia Chao and colleagues establishes six dimensions of organization socialization.

* Performance Proficiency
* People
* Politics
* Language
* Organizational Goals and Values
* History

## Performance Proficiency
"the identification of what needs to be learned and how well an individual masters teh requires knowledge, skills, and abilities"

## People
"establishing successful and satisfying work relationships with organizational members"

"finding the right person or persons from whom to learn about the organization, work group, and job plays a pivotal role in socialization"

## Politics
"concerns teh individual's succes in gaining information regarding formal and informal work relationships and power structures withing the organization. Effective learning and adjustment to a new job or organization could be made more efficient by a hightened awareness of which people are more knowledgeable and powerful than others""

## Language
"knowledge of the profession's technical language as well as knowledge of the acronyms, sland, and jargon that are unique to the organization"

## Organizational Goals and Values
"socialization includes an understanding of the rules or principles that maintain the integrity of the organization... also extends to unwritten, informal, tacit goals and values espoused by members who are in powerful or controlling positions"

## History
"organization's traditions, customs, myths, and rituals are use to transmit cultural knowledge and thereby perpetuate a particular type of organizational member. Knowledge of this history, as well as knowlege about the personal background of particular otganizational members, can help the infividual learn what types of behaviors are appropriate or inapprotiate in specific interactions and circumstances"

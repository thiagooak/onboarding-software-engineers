# Onboarding Software Engineers

In this book, onboarding relates to the process of integrating a new employee into an organization.

We are writing this book because we have seen multiple employee onboarding programs run on inertia - they carry on doing what was always done, maybe with a few small improvements, but never knowing how good or bad their program really is. LinkedIn's 2024 Workplace Learning [report](https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/wlr-2024/LinkedIn-Workplace-Learning-Report-2024.pdf) illustrates this well, as only 1% of large-scale upskilling programs have reached the measuring stage.

There must be a better, more data-driven, and science-informed way to onboard software engineers.

We hope to systematize this better onboarding process as we write this book.

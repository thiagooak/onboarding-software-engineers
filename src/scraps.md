Many employee onboarding programs run on inertia - they carry on doing what was always done, never knowing how effective their program really is. LinkedIn's 2024 Workplace Learning report[^1] illustrates this well, showing that 50% of large-scale upskilling programs reached the planning and activation stages while only 4% reached the measuring stage.

There must be a better, more data-driven, and science-informed way to onboard software engineers.

We hope to systematize this better onboarding process as we write this book.

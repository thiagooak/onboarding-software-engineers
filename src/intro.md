# Introduction

As software engineers, we apply rigorous best practices to build and improve our products.
We define clear metrics, interview users, observe behaviors, and iterate to better serve our customers.
Yet, when it comes to onboarding new engineers, one of the critical experiences shaping their success,
we often fail to apply the same level of product thinking.

This book will explore how organizations can implement evidence-informed engineering onboarding.
We’ll introduce key learning design principles, such as guided interaction and worked examples,
to create onboarding experiences that are both effective and engaging.
By blending product development methodologies with research-backed learning strategies,
teams can accelerate productivity, improve retention, and foster a more inclusive developer experience.

Adding new people to a project always slows things down. Ineffective onboarding slows it more than necessary.
Without a well-designed process, new engineers take longer to ramp up and risk becoming disengaged.

Hiring is hard and expensive. Increasing new engineer’s chances of success with a small investment in structured onboarding,
can save you and your new hires significant time and frustration.

Let's explore how to create a smoother and more effective onboarding process.

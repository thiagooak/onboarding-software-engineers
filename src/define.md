Onboarding, in this book, relates to the process of integrating a new employee into an organization.

This integration goes beyond knowing where the coffee machine is, how to book vacations, and what's the tech stack.
It includes understanding the company's culture and goals, its engineering culture, idioms, procedures, and best practices.

Borrowing an illustration from Krystal Higgins' excellent book "Better Onboarding",
onboarding humans into an organization is different than setting up a new printer.
If you are the kind of person that reads instructions before using a new product,
you might have noticed that user manuals usually start with a sentence like "Getting Started"
and end with something to the effect of "You are all set!"
These two sentences imply that all you need to now is contained between them. That is,
if you have read everything attentively and preferrably in order. Now, if the paper jams, you can't find the right drivers, or your printer keeps complaining that it lacks magenta, that's on you.
